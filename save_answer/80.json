However, the lack of traffic also means that drivers must remain more vigilant for potential hazards or changes in road conditions. In Image2, the road is a two-lane highway with a center turn lane, which can make it easier for drivers to change lanes or make turns without impeding traffic flow. However, the presence of a highway can also mean higher speeds and more traffic, which can increase the risk of accidents. In Image3, the road is a country road with a stop sign and a fork in the road, which can be confusing for drivers who may not be familiar with the area.
