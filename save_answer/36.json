In the 1960s, racing regulations were becoming more strict, and organizers were trying to reduce the risks associated with high-speed racing. One of the key changes in regulations was the introduction of roll-over protection systems (ROPS) for drivers. This required race cars to have a rigid structure that could withstand a rollover accident and protect the driver from injury.\nIn addition to ROPS, racing regulations also became more focused on safety for spectators. This led to the introduction of\u56f4\u573a(wall)\u5236\u5ea6, which required cars to be parked in designated areas before the race. This helped to reduce the risk of accidents and ensure that spectators were kept at a safe distance from the racetrack.\nThese changes in regulations had a significant impact on the design of race cars, as seen in Image1 and Image2. Both cars have a strong, rigid structure that provides protection for the driver in case of an accident. The Can-Am car has a more aerodynamic body with a large fin on the hood and a shark fin on the roof, while the Spyder race car has a more traditional sports car shape with a smaller, more streamlined body.
