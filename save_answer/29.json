In Image1, the leaves of Caltha palustris are large and have thick veins, which give the plant a strong and sturdy appearance. The leaves are arranged in a radial pattern, with each leaf extending out from the central stem. This arrangement helps the plant to maximize its surface area for photosynthesis and also provides a protective barrier against predators. In Image2, the leaves of Rhododendron periclymenoides are small and green, arranged in a more compact manner. This arrangement allows the plant to conserve water and nutrients, as well as to better withstand harsh environmental conditions.
