First, both images feature the same characters from the television series \"The Simpsons\". This consistency in character design is a hallmark of the animation style used in the series. Second, both images use a flat, cartoony style to depict the characters. This style is typical of the animation style used in \"The Simpsons\", which emphasizes bold, simple shapes and bright, vibrant colors. Finally, both images use a limited color palette, with the characters and background elements all depicted in the same color scheme.
