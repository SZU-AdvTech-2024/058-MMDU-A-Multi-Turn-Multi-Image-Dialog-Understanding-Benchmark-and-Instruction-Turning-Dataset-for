Human presence can have both positive and negative impacts on wildlife. On one hand, humans can provide food or water sources for animals, which can be beneficial for their survival. On the other hand, human activities such as hunting, poaching, or habitat destruction can threaten the survival of wildlife. Ethical considerations arise from such scenarios, as it is important to respect and protect wildlife while also considering the needs of humans. For instance, it is crucial to maintain a safe distance from wild animals and not to disturb their natural habitats, as this can lead to stress and harm to the animals.
